# VÃ¢rli's Souls Archive

"Soulslike" are a video game genre commonly known for their high difficulty, especially boss fights.
Being a fan of these games, this app is dedicated to being an archive of my walkthroughs of this games (first time beating bosses, running various builds, etc.), and also including tips on how to beat said bosses.

This is a collaborative project dedicated to learn React in-depth, as well as how to structure frontend projects. So take everything with a grain of salt.
